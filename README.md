Integrates [OWASP ZAP] reports into SonarQube v7.x or higher. The target version
of SonarQube is the current LTS version.

## About ZAP

OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing
tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and
as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing.

ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find
security vulnerabilities manually.

## Metrics

The plugin keeps track of the following statistics:

* Total number of high, medium, low, and info severity findings

Additionally, the following metric is defined:

### Identified Risk Score (IRS)

(high &times; 5) + (medium &times; 3) + (low &times; 1)

The IRS is simply a weighted measurement of the vulnerabilities identified
during a scan. It does not measure the actual risk posed by the findings.

## Installation

Copy the plugin (jar file) to `$SONAR_INSTALL_DIR/extensions/plugins` and
restart SonarQube.

## Plugin Configuration

A typical SonarQube configuration will have the following parameters. This
example assumes the use of a Jenkins workspace, but can easily be altered for
other CI/CD systems.

```ini
sonar.zaproxy.reportPath=${WORKSPACE}/zaproxy-report.xml
# Optional - specifies additional rules outside of what's included in the core
sonar.zaproxy.rulesFilePath=${WORKSPACE}/myrules.xml
```

## Compiling

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will build the plugin into a jar file into `sonar-zap-plugin/target/sonar-zap-plugin-<version>.jar`.

If the `docker` property is set, a Docker image will also be created for testing.
The image will be named `org.sonarsource.owasp/sonar-zap-plugin:<version>` and
will have the supported version of SonarQube pulled from Docker Hub with the
newly-built zap-sonar-plugin installed.

To make sure the Docker image is always created when building locally, you can
set the docker property in an active profile in your `settings.xml`:

```xml
<settings>
...
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>docker</id>
      <properties>
        <docker>true</docker>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>

  <activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>docker</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
...
</settings>
```

## Testing

Once the Docker image is built, it can be started with

```bash
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 org.sonarsource.owasp/sonar-zap-plugin:version
```

The SonarQube server may take a few minutes to start. You can check it with

```bash
docker logs sonarqube
```

and look for a line that says `SonarQube is up`.

Then run an analysis using the test report:

```bash
cd sonar-zap-plugin
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.zaproxy.reportPath=${PWD}/src/test/resources/report/zaproxy-report.xml
```

The path must be an absolute path. If your shell does not support `${PWD}`,
replace it with the full path to the test report.

The results can be viewed at <http://localhost:9000/project/issues?id=org.sonarsource.owasp%3Asonar-zap-plugin&resolved=false&tags=zaproxy>.
There should be 14 issues: 1 Major, 9 Minor, 4 Info.

## Releasing

You will need a valid code signing key registered with OSSRH, which @gotimer has
now.

Once the changes are pushed, all checks come back clean, and the version number
is updated for release, then merge the pull request into `master`.

On the `master` branch:

```bash
mvn clean deploy -P release
git tag -a sonar-zap-plugin-1.2.0 -m 'Support for SonarQube 7.9 LTS'
git push --tags origin
```

## History

The ZAP SonarQube Plugin is derived from the
[OWASP Dependency-Check SonarQube Plugin]. Version 1.0 of the Dependency-Check
plugin was [forked] by [Polymont] with the intent of creating a generic OWASP
SonarQube plugin to support any OWASP project. The ZAP team wanted their own
SonarQube plugin independent of any other project. In addition, a number of
critical defects were discovered in the initial release of the Dependency-Check
SonarQube plugin that were later fixed in subsequent releases, but never
addressed in the generic OWASP version. The ZAP SonarQube Plugin is based on
v1.0.3 of the Dependency-Check SonarQube plugin with ZAP-specific contributions
by [Polymont].
